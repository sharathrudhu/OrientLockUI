You're working on a responsive web layout that, on desktop, features a left-side menu (aside) and a content area (article) on the right. On mobile devices, the aside is hidden, allowing the article to occupy the full width of the screen.

You aim to implement a specific behavior for mobile devices in landscape mode:

Landscape Mode on Mobile: The content within the article should be rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise, ensuring that the design remains visually consistent, regardless of whether the device is in portrait or landscape orientation.
However, you're facing challenges, particularly when adding a background image to the article. The background image should scale and position correctly after the rotation, ensuring that the content remains readable and aesthetically pleasing.

Key Requirements:

Hide the aside element on mobile devices (already implemented).
Rotate the content within the article by 90 degrees anti-clockwise specifically when the mobile device is in landscape mode.
Ensure that any background image added to the article scales and positions correctly after the rotation, maintaining the intended visual design and readability.
Maintain consistent design and usability across different mobile orientations (portrait and landscape).
This setup will ensure the visual layout and background images are handled appropriately, providing a consistent and functional user experience across various device orientations.
